      <meta name="description" content="A Website Usability Analysis can identify issues you don't even know you have. On the Web, people won't bother to tell you why they left without buying! Our user-experts walk through the site as a customer would and notice any issues that may block people from being able to easily use your site. Are you so familiar with the layout and content of your web pages that you know where to go to find what you want without even thinking about it? Have you ever considered that your visitors probably are not familiar with the layout of your web pages and so cannot instinctively find their way around. A usability analysis can tell you which part of your page users view first, how long they stay and where they go next. This analytical look at your web pages can inform the layout, content and overall look of a page to ensure maximum impact; for example if the majority of users look at the bottom left-hand of a page first, then that may be the ideal spot to advertise any special offers or contact details. Usability is not about waving a magic wand; it is about analysing how a user interacts with a web page and using that information to make your site as user-friendly as possible">
